## Login
- [✔️] It should be contained in a box and should be activated by the login button in the menu bar
- [✔️] It should slide into view when the login button is clicked(jQuery will most likely be needed for this)
- [✔️] If the login box is active and the user clicks outside it, the box should disappear
 
## Sign Up
- [ ] It will operate similar to login in but will have data pulled from the sign up file
- [ ] It should also disappear if the user clicks outside of it
