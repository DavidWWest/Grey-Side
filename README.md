## What do we do?
We make tools that people can use to make money on the Internet. We want to give users the ability to be independent of limitations that the real world can have when it comes to employment.

When it comes to Grey Side, a user does not have to have a resume, work experience, references, or do an interview just to be able to start making money. All it takes is a computer, an internet connection, a good idea, and willingness to make the idea happen. We help take care of the rest.

The key to making money online lies with the power of community. Users do not have to censor themselves like they have to do in a workplace in the real world.They are free to behave how they wish, as long as they continue to appeal to their audience.

This repository contains code for the homepage that will be the center of where all Grey Side products reside.It will contain information about the company's mission and philosophy, associated products, and it will give the user the ability to read up on the basic structure of how all the products will work

Each project is linked to their respective repositories. Each project has a wiki that goes into deeper detail about the project that its under.

The different repositories are as follows:

## [Advertising](https://github.com/s24569/Advertising)
* Ad space rotates based on a weekly basis
* The system is auction based. The top 3 highest paying bidders will have the ad space for the week. When the bidding session ends, the 3 bidding amounts will be added together and then paid out to the ad hoster

## [Subscriptions](https://github.com/s24569/Subscriptions)
* Users will be able to subscribe to their favorite developers for notifications and access to content as soon as it's made public
* Users can also have the option to donate money to their favorite developers

## [Game Space](https://github.com/s24569/The-Game-Space):
* Gives users the ability to build, market, and make money off of games
* UI is designed to be incredibly simple in order to minimize learning curve(users should not have to know any programming in advance)

## [Decibell](https://github.com/s24569/decibell)
* Gives users the ability to collaborate with music
* System is similar to Git, where users can borrow a song, edit it, and push it to the playlist as a suggestion for the original artist to use
* There will also be a tracking system that is similar to Git where an artist can track changes being made to a song so that they can still retain control of it while getting creative input
